Genesis 24-29

The study of this lesson will strengthen class members’ desires to live worthy of their birthright blessings and of eternal marriage.


## Abraham Emphasized Marriage In The Covenant

Abraham wanted Isaac to marry someone of his own faith so he could marry in the covenant. This was necessary so the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant could be given to Abraham’s descendants.

[Genesis 24: 2-4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/24.2-4?lang=eng#2)
>2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
>
>3 And I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:
>
>4 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.

[Genesis 24: 10, 14-15](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/24.10%2C14-15?lang=eng#10)
>10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master werein his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
>
>14 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.
>
>15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.

[Genesis 24:17-20](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/24.17-20?lang=eng#17)
>17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.
>
>18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
>
>19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
>
>20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.

>“Let us plan for and teach and plead with our children to marry in the house of the Lord. Let us reaffirm more vigorously than we ever have in the past that it does matter where you marry and by what authority you are pronounced man and wife”

## God gives revelation to women as well as men

Scriptural accounts of revelation tell mostly of God’s interactions with priesthood leaders, who were men. However, Genesis 25:22–23 contains an account of God giving revelation to a woman.

[Genesis 25: 22-23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/25.22-23?lang=eng#22)
>22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the Lord.
>
>23 And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.


>“May I now take our common ancestor, Rebekah, as a pattern for what her daughters in the Church today can do? … When Rebekah was troubled and needed divine guidance she herself took the matter up with the Lord, and he spoke to her in reply. The Lord gives revelation to women who pray to him in faith”

## Esau sells his birthright to Jacob

Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote: “It appears that anciently under the Patriarchal Order certain special blessings, rights, powers, and privileges—collectively called the birthright—passed from the father to his firstborn son. (Gen. 43:33.)

[Genesis 25: 30-33](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/25.30-33?lang=eng#30)
>30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
>
>31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
> 
>32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
> 
>33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.


## Jacob marries Leah and Rachel in the covenant, and through him the Abrahamic covenant continues

[Genesis 28:1–5; 29:1–28](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/28.1-5?lang=eng#1). One thing we can learn is that marriage in the covenant was very important to Jacob. He made a long journey to find a faithful woman to marry. He then worked for Laban for seven years before marrying Rachel and continued to work for him afterward.

### Modern Day Example

President Gordon B. Hinckley told of a family who joined the Church in Australia and then sold all their possessions so they could travel to New Zealand and be sealed as a family. The father of this family said: 
>“We could not afford to come to the temple. Our worldly possessions consisted of an old car, our furniture, and our dishes. I said to my family, ‘We cannot afford not to go. If the Lord will give me strength, I can work and earn enough for another car and furniture and dishes, but if I should lose these my loved ones, I would be poor indeed in both life and in eternity’”.
