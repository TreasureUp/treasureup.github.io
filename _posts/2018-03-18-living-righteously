# Living Righteously in a Wicked World
## [Genesis 13-14; 18-19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/13?lang=eng)

## Background on Abraham’s Travels
Raised in Ur of Chaldea, then was led by the Lord to settle in Haran ([Genesis 11:31](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/11.31?lang=eng); [Abraham 2:1–5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/2.1-5?lang=eng#0)). The Lord later led him from Haran to the land of Canaan and promised, “Unto thy seed will I give this land” ([Genesis 12:7]((https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/12.7?lang=eng))). Because of a famine in Canaan, Abraham and his family went to Egypt ([Genesis 12:10]((https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/12.10?lang=eng))). Genesis 13 begins with Abraham and his family returning to Canaan from Egypt.

## Abraham and his family settle in Hebron, and Lot and his family settle near Sodom
[Genesis 13:5-9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/13.5-9?lang=eng)

> 5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
>
> 6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
>
> 7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaaniteand the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
>
> 8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.
>
> 9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.

### How can we follow Abraham’s example when we have conflicts with family members or others?

[Genesis 13:10-13](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/13.10-13?lang=eng)

> 10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.
>
> 11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
> 
> 12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
>
> 13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.

At first Lot “lived in the cities of the plain,” outside Sodom, but he “pitched his tent toward Sodom” ([Genesis 13:12]((https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/13.12?lang=eng))). Later he lived in the city of Sodom itself ([Genesis 14:12]((https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/14.12?lang=eng))). What things might we do that are the spiritual equivalent of pitching our tents toward Sodom? (*We may associate with evil things instead of shunning them, or we may allow ourselves to commit small sins without thinking that they may lead to bigger ones*) 

### How can we change our behavior before little problems or sins become big ones?

In contrast to Lot, the people of King Benjamin in the Book of Mormon chose to pitch their tents in the direction of the Lord’s house—the temple ([Mosiah 2:6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2)). As Latter-day Saints, we need to assure that our homes are properly positioned toward holy rather than worldly places.

## Abraham rescues Lot, pays tithes to Melchizedek, and refuses to accept the spoils of war from the king of Sodom

While Lot lived in Sodom, the kings of several city-states, including Sodom and Gomorrah, began warring with one another ([Genesis 14:1–2, 8–9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/14.1-2%2C8-9?lang=eng#0)). 

When Abram learned of Lot’s capture, he gathered and armed his servants and pursued the armies. He caught up with them, and during the ensuing battle, Abram and his allies freed the captives.

**Genesis 14:17-18** – Welcomed by the kings after his victory, Abraham met and was blessed by Melchizedek, king of Salem and “the priest of the most high God”.

**Genesis 14:20 (JST 14:36-40)** – It is recorded here that Abraham paid his tithing to Melchizedek.

**Genesis 14:21-24** – Rather than have it said that the king of Sodom had rewarded him, Abraham refused to take the recaptured goods that were offered to him for his service.

### What can we learn about Abraham’s commitment to the Lord by comparing his reactions to Melchizedek and to the king of Sodom?

## The Lord destroys Sodom and Gomorrah
**[Genesis 18:20-21](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/18.20-21?lang=eng)**. Seeing the iniquity that had taken hold in Sodom and Gomorrah, the Lord decided to destroy the cities.

**[Genesis 19:17](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/19.17?lang=eng)** Lot and his family were counseled not to look back as they to fled to the mountain. 

**[Genesis 19:26](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/19.26?lang=eng)** – Lot’s wife, lagging back and looking back toward Sodom, paid a high price. 

**[Genesis 19:29](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/19.29?lang=eng)** indicates that Lot was spared because he was Abraham’s brother. We too can have a saving effect on those around us when we chose righteousness and obedience to the Lord.

> “Our world is now much the same as it was in the days of the Nephite prophet who said: ‘ … if it were not for the prayers of the righteous … ye would even now be visited with utter destruction. …’ (Al. 10:22.) Of course, there are many many upright and faithful who live all the commandments and whose lives and prayers keep the world from destruction”

> President Spencer W Kimball

>“In the Church, we often state the couplet, ‘Be in the world but not of the world.’ As we observe television shows that make profanity, violence, and infidelity commonplace and even glamorous, we often wish we could lock out the world in some way and isolate our families from it all. …
> 
> “Perhaps we should state the couplet previously mentioned as two separate admonitions. First, ‘Be in the world.’ Be involved; be informed. Try to be understanding and tolerant and to appreciate diversity. Make meaningful contributions to society through service and involvement. Second, ‘Be not of the world.’ Do not follow wrong paths or bend to accommodate or accept what is not right. …
> 
>“Members of the Church need to influence more than we are influenced. We should work to stem the tide of sin and evil instead of passively being swept along by it. We each need to help solve the problem rather than avoid or ignore it”
>
> Elder M Russell Ballard
