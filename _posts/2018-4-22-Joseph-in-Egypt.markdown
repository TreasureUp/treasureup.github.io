> "Just as it is important to prepare ourselves spiritually, we must also prepare ourselves for our temporal needs. … We have been instructed for years to follow at least four requirements in preparing for that which is to come."
>- First, gain an adequate education.
>- Second, live strictly within your income and save something for a rainy day.
>- Third, avoid excessive debt.
>- Fourth, acquire and store a reserve of food and supplies that will sustain life [if local laws permit such storage].
