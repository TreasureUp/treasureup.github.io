## Trials Joseph experienced in the early part of his life 
([Genesis 37](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/37?lang=eng); [39](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/39?lang=eng)).
  - He was hated by his brothers ([Genesis 37:4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/37.4?lang=eng#3)).
  - His brothers conspired to kill him, then sold him as a slave instead ([Genesis 37:18–28](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/37.18-28?lang=eng#17)).
  - He was unjustly put in prison after refusing to do evil ([Genesis 39:20](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/39.20?lang=eng#19)).

### [Genesis 39:21-22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/39.21-22?lang=eng#19)
>21 ¶ But the Lord was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
>
>22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.

## Joseph interprets the dreams of the butler, the baker and Pharaoh.

[Genesis 40:1,3,5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/40.1-5?lang=eng#13)

>1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
>
>3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
>
>5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.

[Genesis 40: 8, 12-15](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/40.8-15?lang=eng#13)

>8 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.
>
>12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:
>
>13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
>
>14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
>
>15 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.

[Genesis 40: 20-23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/40.20-23?lang=eng#20)

>20 ¶ And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
>
>21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:
>
>22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
>
>23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

[Genesis 41:8, 17–24](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/41.17-24?lang=eng#0)

>8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.

[Genesis 41:25–32](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/41.25-32?lang=eng#24).

>25 ¶ And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.
>
26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
>
>27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
>
>28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
>
>29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
>
>30 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
>
>31 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.
>
>32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

> "Just as it is important to prepare ourselves spiritually, we must also prepare ourselves for our temporal needs. … We have been instructed for years to follow at least four requirements in preparing for that which is to come."
>- First, gain an adequate education.
>- Second, live strictly within your income and save something for a rainy day.
>- Third, avoid excessive debt.
>- Fourth, acquire and store a reserve of food and supplies that will sustain life [if local laws permit such storage].
