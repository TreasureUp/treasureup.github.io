# Elder L. Tom Perry taught:

Just as it is important to prepare ourselves spiritually, we must also prepare ourselves for our temporal needs. … We have been instructed for years to follow at least four requirements in preparing for that which is to come.

- First, gain an adequate education.
- Second, live strictly within your income and save something for a rainy day.
- Third, avoid excessive debt.
- Fourth, acquire and store a reserve of food and supplies that will sustain life [if local laws permit such storage].
