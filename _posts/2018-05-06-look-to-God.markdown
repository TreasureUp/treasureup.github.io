## Aaron and Miriam Murmur
[Numbers 12: 1-8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/num/12.1-8?lang=eng#0)

> The prophets, seers, and revelators have had and still have the responsibility and privilege of receiving and declaring the word of God for the world. Individual members, parents, and leaders have the right to receive revelation for their own responsibility but have no duty nor right to declare the word of God beyond the limits of their own responsibility.

### The 12 Report their Findings
[Numbers 13: 23-33](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/num/13.23-33?lang=eng#22)

> Ten of the spies were victims of their own doubts and fears. They gave a negative report of the numbers and stature of the Canaanites. … They compared themselves as grasshoppers to the giants they had seen in the land. …
> We see some around us who are indifferent concerning the future of this work, who are apathetic, who speak of limitations, who express fears, who spend their time digging out and writing about what they regard to be weaknesses which really are of no consequence. With doubt concerning its past, they have no vision concerning its future.

### Joshua and Caleb are Faithful
> "The Lord is with us: fear them not."
[Numbers 14: 1-9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/num/14.1-9?lang=eng#0)

> There is no place in this work for those who believe only in the gospel of doom and gloom. The gospel is good news. It is a message of triumph. It is a cause to be embraced with enthusiasm.
> The Lord never said that there would not be troubles. Our people have known afflictions of every sort as those who have opposed this work have come upon them. But faith has shown through all their sorrows. This work has consistently moved forward and has never taken a backward step since its inception. …
> This is an age of pessimism. Ours is a mission of faith. To my brethren and sisters everywhere, I call upon you to reaffirm your faith, to move this work forward across the world. You can make it stronger by the manner in which you live.
>
> President Gordon B Hinckley

[Helaman 8:15](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/8.15?lang=eng#14)

What does it mean to look to Christ?

> We, like Israel of old, must rivet our eyes and minds upon … Christ if we hope to gain eternal life. … Our looks must not be allowed to wander across the way or to become fixed upon the perishable things of the world. The eye … must be trained to look upward. We must look to God and live!
